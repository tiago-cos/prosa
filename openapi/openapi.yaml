    # Overview

    Prosa is a self-hosted book server for managing and reading your personal collection.

    ## Main Features

    ### Book Management

    - Manage EPUB files, including metadata and cover images
    - Organize books into shelves

    ### Reading, Annotations & Ratings

    - Track and store reading progress for each book
    - Add and manage book annotations
    - Rate books

    ### Automatic Metadata Fetching

    - Automatically extract book metadata from various providers

    ### User & Device Support

    - Support multiple users with different roles (regular and admin)
    - Sync books, annotations, and reading progress across multiple devices

    ## User Types

    - **Regular Users** – Can perform operations only on their own books
    - **Admin Users** – Have full access to perform any operation on any book in the system

    ## Authentication

    - **JWT tokens** – Obtain from the authentication endpoint
    - **API keys** – Create in your user preferences

    # Configuration

    Prosa can be configured in two ways:

    1. **Configuration files (TOML)**
    2. **Environment variables**

    The configuration system is layered, meaning defaults are loaded first and then overridden by local configuration or environment variables.

    ## Default Configuration

    Prosa ships with a default configuration file located at `src/config/default.toml`.

    This file is always loaded when the program starts.  
    You can change the path where Prosa looks for the default configuration by setting the `DEFAULT_CONFIGURATION` environment variable. If not specified, it defaults to `src/config/default.toml`.

    ### Example `default.toml`

    ```toml
    [server]
    host = "0.0.0.0"
    port = 5000

    # Define secret_key and admin_key in local configuration

    [auth]
    # secret_key = "jwt_secret_key"
    # admin_key = "admin_key"
    jwt_token_duration = 900
    refresh_token_duration = 604800
    allow_user_registration = true

    [book_storage]
    epub_path = "library/epubs"
    cover_path = "library/covers"

    [metadata_cooldown]
    goodreads = 1000
    epub_extractor = 0

    [database]
    file_path = "library/database.db"

    [kepubify]
    path = "kepubify/kepubify"
    ```

    ## Local Configuration

    Any value from the default configuration can be overridden by creating a local configuration file.

    By default, Prosa looks for `src/config/local.toml`.

    You can change this path using the `LOCAL_CONFIGURATION` environment variable.  
    Values defined in `local.toml` will take precedence over `default.toml`.

    ## Environment Variables

    All configuration values can also be controlled directly through environment variables.  
    The format is `<SECTION>__<KEY>`.

    -   Sections map to the `[section]` headers in the TOML file.
        
    -   Keys map to the field names inside each section.

    **Important:**

    - Sections and keys are separated using **double underscores (`__`)**.
        
    - Single underscores (`_`) inside a key name (e.g. `admin_key`) remain as-is and **are not separators**.
        
    For example:

    - To set the server port (`[server].port`):
        
      ```bash
      export SERVER__PORT=8080
      ```

    - To set the admin key (`[auth].admin_key`):  
      _(notice there is only **one underscore** between `ADMIN` and `KEY` because the field name itself has an underscore)_
        
      ```bash
      export AUTH__ADMIN_KEY=super_secret_key
      ```

    ## Configuration Reference

    -   **[server]**
        
        -   `host`: Network interface where the server will listen.
            
        -   `port`: Port number the server will listen on.
            
    -   **[auth]**
        
        -   `secret_key`: Secret key used for JWT encoding. **Must be defined and at least 16 characters long.**  
        The server will not start if this is missing or too short.
        
        -   `admin_key`: Secret used to register admin users. **Must be defined and at least 16 characters long.**  
        The server will not start if this is missing or too short.
            
        -   `jwt_token_duration`: Expiration duration for JWT tokens (seconds).
            
        -   `refresh_token_duration`: Expiration duration for refresh tokens (seconds).

        -   `allow_user_registration`: Whether new users can register without an admin key.  
        Set to `true` to allow anyone to register and `false` to require the admin key for all registrations.
            
    -   **[book_storage]**
        
        -   `epub_path`: Directory where EPUB files are stored.
            
        -   `cover_path`: Directory where cover images are stored.
            
    -   **[metadata_cooldown]**
        
        -   `goodreads`: Minimum delay (ms) between Goodreads metadata fetch attempts.
            
        -   `epub_extractor`: Minimum delay (ms) between EPUB extractor metadata fetch attempts.
            
    -   **[database]**
        
        -   `file_path`: Path to the SQLite database file.
            
    -   **[kepubify]**
        
        -   `path`: Path to the `kepubify` binary.

    ## Logging

    You can control the logging level using the standard `RUST_LOG` environment variable.  
    Supported values include `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, and `trace`.

    - Default:
      ```bash
      RUST_LOG=info
      ```
        
    - Example (set log level to warn):
      ```bash
      export RUST_LOG=warn
      ```

    # Installation & Setup

    Prosa can be run either as a **Docker container (recommended)** or as a standalone **binary**.

    ## Docker Container (Recommended)

    The simplest way to get Prosa running is with Docker. Add the following entry to your `docker-compose.yml`:

    ```yaml
    services:
      prosa:
        image: tsousa28/prosa
        container_name: prosa
        ports:
          - "5000:5000"
        environment:
          - AUTH__ADMIN_KEY=very_secret_key
          - AUTH__SECRET_KEY=another_very_secret_key
        volumes:
          - prosa_library:/app/library
        restart: unless-stopped

    volumes:
      prosa_library:
    ```

    This will start Prosa and make it available on port `5000`.

    **Important notes:**

    -  Set both secret keys (`AUTH__ADMIN_KEY` and `AUTH__SECRET_KEY`) to secure values before using Prosa.
        
    -  Persistence requires a **named volume** mounted at `/app/library` inside the container. Bind mounts are currently not supported due to permission issues in the rootless container.
        
    -  Environment variables to change paths are ignored in this container image.
        
    ## Binary

    If you prefer running Prosa as a binary:

    1.  **Install Kepubify**  
        Prosa depends on [`kepubify`](https://github.com/tiago-cos/kepubify).
        
        -   Download the latest **kepubify-linux-64bit** release from [GitHub](https://github.com/tiago-cos/kepubify/releases/latest).
            
        -   Place it somewhere accessible on your system.
            
        -   Configure its path in Prosa via the [Local Configuration](#section/Configuration/Local-Configuration) under `[kepubify].path`.
            
    2.  **Configure Prosa**  
        Adjust the configuration file as needed (authentication, storage paths, etc.).
        
    3.  **Run the Server**  
        Launch the binary, and Prosa will be ready to accept connections.

    ## Next Steps

    1.  **Create a User**  
        Register a new user with the [Register User](#tag/Authentication/operation/register) endpoint.
        
    2.  **(Optional) Enable Goodreads Metadata**  
        By default, Goodreads metadata extraction is **disabled**.
        
        -   To enable it, update your preferences with the [Patch User Preferences](#tag/Preferences/operation/patchPreferences) endpoint.
            
        -   Add `"goodreads_metadata_extractor"` to the `metadata_providers` array.
            
    3.  **Upload Your First Book**  
        Add a book using the [Upload Book](#tag/File/operation/uploadBook) endpoint. You can also manage metadata and cover images at this stage.

    You’re now ready to browse, read, and annotate your books with Prosa!
